# MINI PDF

> Backend API for PDF converter.

## Introduction

Mini PDF is a side project I developed for learning purposes. It's a miniature clone of popular file converter app smallpdf.com. This is the backend API built with JAVA/Springboot & PostgreSQL, deployed on AWS.

## Features

While this is not a 100% working clone as the app is pretty large with a lot of moving parts, I tried to implement most of the basic features of Small PDF.

- Convert PDF to DOCX
- Convert DOCX to PDF 
- Convert IMAGE to PDF
- Download converted files


See DOCS for working endpoints

## Development

> Java 11, Spring Boot 2.4, Maven, Postgres, Swagger, Git, Jenkins, AWS
